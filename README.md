# GitHub Tile Art

A Qt C++ app to customize GitHub activity overview. Basically a C++ port of [this python GUI app](https://github.com/heckerfr0d/github-abuz).  
Soo, for some reason pyinstaller stopped working for me so I ported the app to C++ (dum, I know 🙂). I thought it'd be easy (so naive 🤦). It soo wasn't but I couldn't leave it unfinished so finally here it is :)  
  
  
README is still WIP check back later 😁
